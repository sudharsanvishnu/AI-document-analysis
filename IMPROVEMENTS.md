# Answer Quality Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to enhance the accuracy and quality of answers generated by the AI document analysis system.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering
- **Improved Context Instructions**: The prompt now includes specific guidelines for the AI to base answers only on provided context
- **Better Structure**: Clear formatting requirements for well-structured, coherent responses
- **Accuracy Focus**: Instructions to clearly state when information is insufficient

### 2. Better Context Retrieval
- **Improved Relevance Scoring**: Enhanced algorithm that considers word overlap, phrase matches, and exact phrase matches
- **Distance-based Filtering**: Only includes chunks with relevance distance < 1.5
- **Increased Context Size**: Retrieves up to 12 relevant chunks (increased from 8)
- **Better Text Preprocessing**: Normalizes unicode characters and removes excessive punctuation

### 3. Enhanced Document Processing
- **Larger Chunk Size**: Increased from 500 to 800 characters for better context preservation
- **Better Overlap**: Increased chunk overlap from 50 to 150 characters for continuity
- **Improved Separators**: Better text splitting using paragraph breaks, sentences, and words
- **Content Filtering**: Only keeps chunks with substantial content (>100 characters)

### 4. Optimized Model Parameters
- **Lower Temperature**: Reduced to 0.2 for more consistent answers
- **Better Top-p**: Set to 0.8 for focused responses
- **Increased Token Limit**: Allows up to 800 tokens for more complete answers
- **Repeat Penalty**: Reduces repetitive content

### 5. Improved Answer Formatting
- **Post-processing**: Cleans up redundant phrases and ensures proper sentence endings
- **Length Management**: Intelligently truncates while preserving sentence structure
- **Better Fallback**: Enhanced extraction-based answer generation when Ollama is unavailable

## Configuration Options

The system now supports configurable parameters through environment variables:

```bash
# Answer Generation Settings
MAX_ANSWER_LENGTH=800          # Maximum answer length
MIN_CHUNK_LENGTH=100          # Minimum chunk length to include
TOP_K_CHUNKS=12               # Number of chunks to retrieve
RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD=1.5       # Maximum distance for relevant chunks

# Ollama Settings
OLLAMA_TEMPERATURE=0.2        # Model temperature (0.0-1.0)
OLLAMA_TOP_P=0.8              # Top-p sampling
OLLAMA_MAX_TOKENS=800         # Maximum tokens to generate
OLLAMA_TIMEOUT=45             # API timeout in seconds
```

## Usage

### Testing Answer Quality
Run the test script to verify improvements:

```bash
python scripts/test_answer_quality.py
```

### Reprocessing Documents
To apply the new chunking improvements to existing documents:

```bash
python scripts/ingest_textbooks.py
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **More Accurate Answers**: Better context retrieval and relevance scoring
2. **Well-formed Responses**: Improved formatting and structure
3. **Consistent Quality**: Lower temperature and better prompts
4. **Better Fallback**: Enhanced extraction when AI models are unavailable
5. **Configurable**: Easy to adjust parameters for different use cases

## Technical Details

### Context Retrieval Algorithm
The new relevance scoring considers:
- Word overlap between question and chunks
- Phrase matches (consecutive words)
- Exact phrase matches (highest weight)
- Distance-based filtering from FAISS

### Answer Generation Pipeline
1. **Preprocess**: Clean and normalize text
2. **Retrieve**: Get relevant chunks with distance filtering
3. **Generate**: Use Ollama with optimized parameters
4. **Post-process**: Clean formatting and ensure proper structure
5. **Fallback**: Use improved extraction if AI model fails

### Model Priority
1. **Ollama with preferred models**: llama3.2:1b, mistral:7b, mistral:latest
2. **Enhanced extraction**: Improved keyword-based answer generation

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Slightly higher due to larger chunks and more context
- **Processing Time**: May be slightly slower due to better relevance scoring
- **Accuracy**: Significantly improved due to better context and prompts
- **Reliability**: Better fallback mechanisms ensure answers are always generated
